# Hello and Welcome
## About Myself
Hi there, my name is Hoang Huynh, a web developer focused on crafting great web experiences. Designing and Coding have been my passion since the days I started working with computers but I found myself into web design/development since. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional websites.

For over past 8 years, I have worked for some of the best digital agencies and wonderful clients to create some award winning works. And, I can make this happen for your business as well.

I look forward to meeting with you and discussing my qualifications in more detail. Please contact me via email at [huynhbahoang91@gmail.com](huynhbahoang91@gmail.com) or (408) 458-6538. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Hoang Huynh
